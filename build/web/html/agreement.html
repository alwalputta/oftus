            Oftus Terms of Service

            Thank you for using Oftus. By using the Oftus service and any related software (collectively the "Service"), 
            you ("You") accept and agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions (the "Agreement"). 
            IF YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, 
            YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, 
            IN WHICH CASE THE TERMS "YOU" OR "YOUR" SHALL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, 
            OR IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU MUST NOT ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT AND MAY NOT 
            USE THE SERVICE.

            The Agreement is effective between (a) You and (b) Elite Global, Inc., a California corporation ("Oftus"). 
            It is effective as of the date You accept this Agreement.

            Oftus may update or change this Agreement from time to time and recommends that you review 
            the Agreement on a regular basis. You understand and agree that your continued use of the Service 
            after the Agreement has changed constitutes your acceptance of the Agreement as revised.

            This Agreement was last updated on July 20, 2013.

            1. Use of the Service

            a. User Accounts. The Service is accessed via individual user accounts ("User Account"). 
            User Accounts are for designated users and cannot be shared or used by more than one user. 
            You are responsible for all activity that takes place on your account. 
            You agree that You are responsible for keeping your password confidential and secure, 
            and further understand that You are solely responsible and liable for any activities that 
            occur under your account and for any harm that you may cause to the Service.

            b. Limitations of Service. You understand and acknowledge that the Service is being provided 
            in "Beta" form, and is made available on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis for the purpose 
            of providing Oftus with feedback on the quality and usability of the Service. 
            The Service may contain errors or inaccuracies that could cause failures, including but not 
            limited to data corruption or loss of data from the Service and from peripherals 
            (including, without limitation, servers and computers) connected thereto. In addition, 
            Oftus is not obligated to provide any maintenance, technical or other support for the Service. 
            You are responsible for backing up, to your own computer or other device, any data that You store 
            or access via the Service.

            You further understand and acknowledge that Oftus has not made the Service generally available, 
            that Oftus has not promised or guaranteed to You that the Service will be announced or 
            made available to anyone in the future, that Oftus has no express or implied obligation 
            to You to announce or introduce the Service, and that Oftus may elect not introduce a 
            generally available version of the Service. Accordingly, You acknowledge that any research or 
            development that You perform regarding the Service or any product associated with the Service is 
            done entirely at Your own risk.

            c. Changing the Service. Oftus reserves the right to modify, suspend or stop the Service 
            (or any part thereof), either temporarily or permanently, at any time or from time to time, 
            with or without prior notice to You. You agree that Oftus shall not be liable to you or 
            any third party for any modification or cessation of the Service. You acknowledge that Oftus 
            has no express or implied obligation to provide, or continue to provide, the Service, or any part thereof, 
            now or in the future. YOU SHOULD FREQUENTLY BACK UP DATA THAT YOU ENTER INTO THE SERVICE AND APPLICATIONS 
            THAT YOU CREATE USING THE SERVICE. IF CLOUD FOUNDRY CEASES PROVIDING THE SERVICE, SUCH DATA AND 
            APPLICATIONS MAY BECOME PERMANENTLY LOST.

            d. Prohibited Uses of Service. Please note the following prohibitions apply to the Service, 
            as provided to you by Elite Global, Inc. Nothing in this Section prevents you from creating your own service 
            with different terms and conditions. You may not access the Service for the purpose of monitoring 
            its availability, performance and functionality, or for any other benchmarking or competitive purposes. 
            Your use of the Service must be in accordance with the documentation. You agree that You are responsible 
            for your own conduct and content while using the Service and for any consequences thereof.

            (iv) upload, post, email or transmit or otherwise make available messages that promote pyramid schemes,

            or other material;

            (vii) restrict or inhibit any other user from using and enjoying the Service;

            If You are located outside of the United States, You further agree to comply with Your own local 
            laws regarding online conduct and acceptable content.

            e. Revocation. Oftus reserves the right to revoke a user generated name or account 
            anytime the name or account is being used to abuse the Service, confuse or mislead users or is 
            generally offensive.

            9. General Information

            a. Choice of Law and Forum. The Agreement and the relationship between You and Oftus 
            shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of 
            law provisions. You and Oftus agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction 
            of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California.

            b. Waiver and Severability of Terms. The failure of Oftus to exercise or enforce any 
            right or provision of the Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. 
            If any provision of the Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, 
            the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' 
            intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Agreement remain in 
            full force and effect.

            c. Export Compliance. Each party shall comply with the export laws and regulations of the 
            United States and other applicable jurisdictions in providing and using the Service. 
            Diversion contrary to U.S. law is prohibited. Without limiting the foregoing, You agree that 
            (1) You are not, and are not acting on behalf of North Korea, Sudan or Syria, or any other 
            country to which the United States has prohibited export transactions; 
            (2) You are not, and are not acting on behalf of, any person or entity listed on the 
            U.S. Treasury Department list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, or the 
            U.S. Commerce Department Denied Persons List or Entity List; and (3) You will not use the Service for, 
            and will not permit the Service to be used for, any purposes prohibited by law, including, 
            without limitation, for any prohibited development, design, manufacture or production of 
            missiles or nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.

            d. Relationship of the Parties. This Agreement does not create a partnership, franchise, 
            joint venture, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship between Oftus and You.

            e. Limitations Period. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, 
            any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of Oftus services or 
            the Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or 
            be forever barred.

            f. Headings. The section headings in the Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or 
            contractual effect.

            g. Trademark License. You hereby grant to Oftus a non-transferable, non-exclusive license 
            during the Term of the Agreement to use your trademark to advertise that You are using the Service.

            h. Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the documents referenced herein constitute the entire 
            agreement between You and Oftus and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior 
            agreements between You and Oftus. You also may be subject to additional terms and 
            conditions that may apply when You use or purchase certain other Oftus services, 
            affiliate services, third-party content or third-party software. There are no third-party 
            beneficiaries to this Agreement.
